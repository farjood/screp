Title: A Package for Enrichment Testing and Visulaization of Single Cell RNA-Seq Clusters
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Nathan Boles
Maintainer: Nathan Boles <nathanboles@neuralsci.org>
Description: Provides methods to visualize the results of Gene Ontology and 
  REACTOME Pathway enrichment tests. The package also provides functions that perform the 
  enrichment tests and prepare data frames compatible with the visualization functions. For 
  GO enrichment, semantic similarity analysis is performed to group terms, and for the 
  REACTOME pathway analysis, terms are grouped into the higher pathways in the tree 
  structure from the REACTOME database website. For pathway analysis two annotations 
  available from the REACTOME database are required. One is the ID to the pathway name, 
  and the other is the pathway relationships to each other. The ID to pathway name file 
  from REACTOME has several small errors (extra spaces,etc) that can result in NAs 
  when prepping for visualization. An easily corrected RP file for Humans is included in the 
  package.
